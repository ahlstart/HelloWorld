First repo, training

Hi Gitters, I use Windowz tools and find anything other extremely obscure and counter-intuitive.

We'll see if I get religion.

Well at least Github Branching is easy, Pull/Compare works nicely (albeit with little labeling on Compare page/phase), and Merge worked in an intuitive way, just like I had designed it. But what is wrong with this editor - no Shift+CTRL+arrow functionality?
